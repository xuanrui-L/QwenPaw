"""Recovering after the native helper goes away.

The capability names a pipe or socket the helper is listening on. It used to be
cached for the life of the process with no way to retire it, so a helper that
crashed left the client reconnecting to a name that answered nothing -- for
every request thereafter, until the backend restarted. The desktop host notices
the dead child and will issue a new capability, but only if asked.
