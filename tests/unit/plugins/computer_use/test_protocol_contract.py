"""The method vocabulary has to mean the same thing on both sides of the wire.

The adapter and the native helper are written in different languages and share
no build step, so their agreement rests on two lists of strings staying in
step.
Nothing catches a drift: a method only one side knows fails at run time as an
unsupported operation, on whichever machine happens to try it.

Both sides state their vocabulary as a single declaration that the code
enforces rather than describes, and this compares the two. Reading a
declaration matters: an earlier version of this file parsed the helper's
dispatch, and reported a method as unhandled the first time two match arms were
grouped -- the code was right and the test was wrong, which is how a suite
teaches people to ignore it.
