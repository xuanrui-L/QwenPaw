"""Which Project transactions still need a journal read.

Every commit asks the same question before it may publish: does another
transaction still sit in a state that requires recovery?  Answering it by
reading ``journal.json`` of every transaction directory ever written made the
check cost grow with project history (observed: 242 directories and 72 ms per
save, on the hot path of every keystroke-triggered patch).

The answer only ever needs the transactions that are *not* terminal.  Journal
states move forward and never return -- ``PREPARED`` -> ``PROJECT_REPLACED`` ->
``RUNTIME_FINALIZED`` / ``ABORTED`` -- so a directory recorded as terminal is
terminal forever, and the handful of ids still in flight are the only ones
worth opening.  Those ids are cached in ``transactions/.journal-index.json``.

The cache is an optimization, never a source of truth:

* It is validated against a fresh directory listing on every commit, and any
  disagreement (an unexpected directory count, an unknown id, a corrupt or
  absent file) falls back to the full scan and rebuilds the index.
* It is only written *after* a scan completed without raising, so an aborted
  commit simply re-reads those journals next time.

Both failure modes cost a scan; neither can hide a transaction that needs
recovery.
